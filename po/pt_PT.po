msgid "## History"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"House Dvaered came forth from a lower caste in the old Empire, a collection "
"of miners, manual labourers, foot soldiers, and outcasts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the gradual decline in authority of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire), "
"the working class became increasingly disgruntled with their social position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They banded together into what could be considered the biggest labour union "
"in all of human history, and started demanding better treatment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) was less than forthcoming, the "
"labourers began to take more drastic measures."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The peaceful labour union demands turned into an armed resistance movement "
"that escalated into open rebellion on several worlds."
msgstr ""

msgid "History names this movement the Dvaered Revolts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the origin of that name is lost to time, it became a badge of honour "
"among the rebelling workers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cycles of civil unrest on the working planets and fruitless attempts on the "
"part of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) to quell it eventually led the "
"Emperor to agree to the Dvaereds' demands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Their leaders were granted the right to establish a Great House, and direct "
"control over a sizeable chunk of space, in reparation for the lives lost "
"during the Dvaered Revolts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Eager to claim their place among the other big players, the Dvaered "
"leadership decided that discipline was the most effective way to shape a "
"society."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"House Dvaered became a military regime, and the values of honour, strength, "
"and discipline were etched into the Dvaered soul."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Government"
msgstr "governo"

msgid "Today, House Dvaered is ruled by the Generals of Dvaered High Command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The amount of Generals varies from time to time, but there are always enough "
"to feed the fires of internal discord."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Influence is usually determined by the amount of medals and commendations a "
"General has collected in their career."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This stands undisputed, for House Dvaered has meticulous protocols for "
"dispensing awards and commendations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In fact, it is the one thing universally agreed upon and honoured in Dvaered "
"society."

msgid "### Warlords"
msgstr "Senhores da Guerra"

msgid ""
"When a General retires from High Command, they often take with them a small "
"contingent of the armed forces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are soldiers and sailors have sworn allegiance to the person, not the "
"banner, and they will continue to serve until the bitter end."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The General, now known as a Warlord, will then use their private military to "
"secure rule over one or more Dvaered worlds, usually by usurping the "
"position from another Warlord."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Though Dvaered High Command is more military than government, it needs a "
"steady stream of funds, manpower and materials to further its agenda."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each Warlord is required to pay a certain portion of their worlds' resources "

"That Golden Age ended when the Empire began to weaken and succumb to its own "
"bureaucratic tendencies, in turn losing control over some of its territories."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Empire's power has declined since then and the security that was ensured "
"in the Golden Age has diminished greatly as the Imperial military, once the "
"guardian of much of inhabited space, now finds itself struggling to keep the "

"The core systems, those in the vicinity of Gamma Polaris, are heavily "

"Though no new colonization efforts were made after the first twenty, as this "

"As you step out of your ship, the sunlight suddenly flickers. The local star "
"in the sky turns blue, then a deep purple, and then goes dark. The whole "
"planet plunges into darkness.\n"
"   Then a voice speaks, louder than an earthquake. It seems to echo inside "
"your bones and from the very centre of the galaxy. \"Oh crap...\" it says.\n"
"   Another voice laughs musically, as if world itself were singing. "
"\"bobbens, did you just destroy the universe, again?\"\n"
"   \"Mmmm, hold on,\" the first voice rumbles. \"...SIGSEGV... libc start "
"main+0xe5... ah ha!  There's the problem.\"  You feel something fundamental "
"in the fabric of reality change. The sensation is like sneezing and "
"hiccuping at the same time. \"There, that should fix it.\"\n"
"   A window opens in the darkness, infinitely far away and infinitely large. "
"A face peeps down at you from the height of eternity.\n"
"   \"Everything all right in there?\""
msgstr ""
"Quando sais da tua nave, a luz do sol cintila repentinamente. A estrela "
"local no céu fica azul, depois um roxo profundo e depois escurece. O planeta "
"inteiro mergulha na escuridão.\n"
"    Então uma voz fala, mais alto do que um terramoto. Parece ecoar dentro "
"dos teus ossos e do centro da galáxia. Ouves \"Oh raios…\"\n"
"    Outra voz ri musicalmente, como se o próprio mundo cantasse. \"Bobbens, "
"acabaste de destruir o universo, novamente?\"\n"
"    \"Mmmm, espera\", a primeira voz resmunga. \"…SIGSEGV… libc start "
"main+0xe5… ah ha! Aí está o problema.\" Sentes algo fundamental no tecido da "
"mudança da realidade. A sensação é como espirrar e soluçar ao mesmo tempo. "
"\"Pronto, isso deve resolver o problema.\"\n"
"    Uma janela abre-se na escuridão, infinitamente distante e infinitamente "
"grande. Um rosto espreita-te do alto da eternidade.\n"
"    \"Tudo bem aí?\""

"But that is neither here nor there. Come, I will take you to the local "

"\"\n"
"   True to his word, the Dvaered liaison escorts you out of the spaceport "
"bar, and within the hour you find yourself deep inside a highly secured "
"Dvaered military complex. You are ushered into a room, in which you find a "
"large table and several important-looking military men. At the head of the "
"table sits a man whose name tag identifies him as Colonel Urnus. Evidently "
"he's the man in charge.\n"
"   A Dvaered soldier instructs you to take a seat."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you take the last empty seat at the table, Colonel Urnus starts the "

"this meeting is about, so let me get right to the point. We have reason to "
"believe the FLF terrorists are operating from a secret base of operations. "
"We know this base is located somewhere in the nebula, and we have recently "
"uncovered intel that indicates the base is likely to be in the {sys} system."
"\"\n"
"   One of the walls lights up, showing part of the galaxy map. The {sys} "
"system is coloured red, and it's pulsating gently.\n"
"   \"Of course, we have conducted patrols in this system, but so far without "
"result. Our sensors are severely impaired by the nebula in this system, so "
"the chances of us finding the terrorist hive by our own devices are slim. "
"Fortunately, our top strategists have come up with a ruse, one that will "
"make the FLF come to us.\"\n"
"   \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" "
"Urnus continues. The image on the wall zooms up to the {sys} system, and a "
"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them. It is important to note that the transponder will "
"work best in the Nebula, which we believe is where the base should be "
"located.\"\n"
"   The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"   \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "
"has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtedly "
"send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"As soon as the FLF ships join the battle, you and the Dvaered ships will "
"disengage and target the FLF instead. Your mission is to render at least one "
"of their ships incapable of fighting, and board it. You can then access the "
"ship's computer and download the flight log, which should contain the "
"location of the FLF base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your "
"mission will be complete.\"\n"
"   The image on the wall updates one last time, simulating the battle as "
"described by Colonel Urnus. Several FLF logos appear, which are promptly "
"surrounded by the Dvaered ones. Then the logos turn grey, indicating that "
"they've been disabled.\n"
"   \"Let me make one thing clear, citizen. You are allowed, even expected, "
"to fire on the Dvaered ships that are firing on you. However, you must make "
"it look you're on the losing side, or the FLF will not come to your aid! So, "
"do NOT disable or destroy any Dvaered ships, and make sure your own armour "
"takes a bit of a beating. This is vital to the success of the mission. Do "
"not fail.\"\n"
"   Colonel Urnus seems to have concluded his explanation, so you, having "
"spotted the obvious flaw in the Dvaereds' plan, pop the question of what "
"happens if the FLF never show up.\n"
"   \"Well,\" the Colonel muses, \"That will mean our intel was probably "
"wrong. But don't worry, citizen, we'll get those terrorists eventually! Now, "

"his briefing. \"Our forces and formation will be such that it appears we are "

"fight.\""

"The schematic updates again, this time showing several small clusters of red "

"   \"The FLF will send out wings of fighters and bombers to engage our "

"but it seems prudent to assume they will outnumber us by a fair margin. Your "

"\"Both squadrons of the DHC station's space security force will be deployed "
"with a full range ships from Vendettas to Goddards. Those squadrons are the "
"'Beta-Storks' and the 'Beta-Hammer' and their mission will be to control "
"medium and heavy ships and to provide heavy firepower in case of need. Our "
"squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and "
"Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.\n"
"   \"The plan is the following: any ship approaching the station will be "
"assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad "
"leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is assigned to you, you will have to "
"approach the ship within 1000 km. Their security clearance code will be "
"automatically requested and processed by the system we'll install in your "
"core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to fly "
"away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.\n"
"   \"Finally, in case something unexpected happens, you will, of course, "
"have to obey orders. Watch your messages closely. A few pilots will be kept "
"in reserve close to the station.\n"
"   \"Oh, and there is another thing I must warn you about: it's the "
"warlord's odd sense of humour. When they see a small ship close to their "
"Goddard, they may get the idea to shoot a small railgun-volley in your "
"direction. Some of them tend to enjoy seeing pilots fend for their lives. "

#. Here, Cynthia's father pays you to track down his daughter.
#. It is alluded to that Cynthia ran away due to her abusive mother.

msgid ""
"\"The main issue is that the system is infested with Za'lek drones. Heavies, "
"bombers, lights, you name it. While usually not a real challenge to a great "
"pilot like you, their sheer numbers make it so that a frontal attack will "
"only end up getting you killed. However, controlling so many drones requires "
"infrastructure, and the Za'lek, being the lazy bums they are, are not "
"commanding them from ships, but using the drone controllers. If you could "
"take them out, that should incapacitate most of the drones and make taking "
"out the hacking centre a piece of cake.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"My recommendation to you is to jump into {sys} and stay low. We've got "
"some really good explosives we'll hook you up with that should let you take "
"out the drone controllers or hacking stations if you can get close enough. "
"So try to sneak past all the drones, plant the bombs on the drone "
"controllers, and once they are out, do the same with the hacking centre. Of "
"course, if you prefer to be old fashioned, you can take the hacking centre "
"down with missiles, railguns, or whatever you have hand. Probably easier "
"said than done, but I know you can do it.\"\n"
"She grins at you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"That said, given the amount of drones, you should probably take a stealthy "
"ship that is also able to take some out if you get found. They are really "
"fast, so it's unlikely you will be able to outrun them while planting the "
"explosives.\"\n"

#. Drinking Aristocrat
#. Author: geekt
#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

"\"With our abilities, each of us had a good chance of earning the promotion. "
"However, since we were in the same study unit, only one of us could be "

"\"After the final exams had been taken and we were only days away from "
"receiving the results, there was an incident. There had been a security "
"breach in the academy's main computer. Someone had hacked the system and "
"altered the data for the final exams, mine to be exact. My grades had been "
"altered to be straight one hundred percent, in every subject. Can you "
"believe that? Someone had actually tried to make it look like I was "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The academy staff wasn't fooled for even a moment. Nobody would be reckless "

"would have been altered is if someone else did it, no doubt in order to "
"discredit me. And you guessed it, the prime suspect was Harja. After all, if "
"I was disqualified, he would certainly have gotten the promotion. Instead, "
"he got what he deserved, and was expelled for his unethical attempt to "
"secure his own success.\""

"\"That's basically the history between me and Harja. Up until you came to "
"me, I just thought of him as an untrustworthy man whose own underhanded plan "
"backfired on him. But here we are, cycles later, and now he's trying to kill "
"me. Why, I wonder? Could he really be so bitter over what happened that he "

#. Run when the pilot scans a target pilot.
#. The cooldown function is triggered when both cooldown starts and when

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets more complex. An outfit pool is created, consisting of
#. the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. In parallel, if the player can't modify their fleet and are over fleet
#. capacity, they are also considered stranded.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
#. Generate a deduplicated list.
#. Iterate to find outfits matching the size and property of the empty
#. core outfit slots.
#. Nothing to fill the slots could be found.
#. Builds the tables of required, equipped, and missing outfits.
#. Clear tables.
#. Find the number of required cores, and their default outfits.

#. -- The mission will automatically fail if all the escorts die

#. -- Do something based on the number of escorts that are alive
#. do_something( alive )
#. -- Cleans up the library

#. Below is a more complex example where the player becomes the leader and the escorts follow and protect the player.
#. ```
#. -- Initialize the library and give the player two escorts that will guard them / help them out
#. function start_convoy ()
