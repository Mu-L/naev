# Hyperspace and Jumping

Ships can travel from star system to star system through hyperspace by using their built-in hyperdrives.
Travelling through hyperspace is called **jumping** and requires fuel specified by the ship being used.
Jumping can only be done from systems connected to each other, and must be done near the vicinity of a jump point.
The [universe map](mechanics/map) depicting which systems are connected.
