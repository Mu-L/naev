# Fleets

Besides your own ship, it is possible to deploy and command a fleet of escort ships when out in space.
You can deploy any spaceworthy ship you own as a fleet member by right-clicking on it or toggling the deployed checkbox on the [equipment tab](mechanics/equipment) while landed at a spaceport.
The amount of ships you can deploy depends on your **fleet capacity**.
Each ship, including your own, requires a certain amount of **fleet capacity**.
The total sum of fleet capacity from your deployed ships may not surpass your **fleet capacity**.
When deployed ships are destroyed, they will regenerate the next time you land.
