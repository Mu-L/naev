The economy is based on the universal currency known as credits and represented with the Â¤ symbol.
Credits are cryptographic-based and stored on credsticks, which are very small and easy to carry.
You can obtain credits by doing [missions](mechanics/missions), [pillaging ships](mechanics/boarding), or [trading](mechanics/trading).
