# Ship Classes

Ships are divided between military and civilian class ships.

## Military Ships

Military ships are focused on warfare and come in different sizes and flavours.

### Large Ships

The large military ships are slow hulks that can dominate the battlefield.
While they have speed and manoeuvrability in general, they make up for this with large amounts of firepower and armour.

* **[Battleship](ships/classes/battleship)**: The largest ships that focus on raw firepower.
* **[Carrier](ships/classes/carrier)**: Very large ships meant to provide support by hosting large amount of fighter ships.
* **[Cruiser](ships/classes/cruiser)**: The smallest of the large ships, which are more flexible and significantly faster than their larger counterparts.

### Medium Ships

Medium military ships play a pivotal role in the battlefield.
They can be designed to either support taking out larger ships with torpedoes, or focused on agility and accurate weapons to take out smaller ships such as bombers or fighters.

* **[Destroyer](ships/classes/destroyer)**: They can pack quite a punch while still maintained some agility.
* **[Corvette](ships/classes/corvette)**: Often used with many launchers, they can focus on torpedoes to take down large ships, or missiles to fight smaller craft.

### Small Ships

* **[Fighter](ships/classes/fighter)**: Although weak in single numbers, fleets of fighters can quickly beat down medium-sized ships, and even threaten larger ones.
* **[Bomber](ships/classes/bomber)**: Often the slowest of the small ships, they tend to focus on missile load-outs to take down larger ships.
* **[Interceptor](ships/classes/interceptor)**: A combination of high agility and firepower, interceptors can quickly take down bombers and other small high priority targets while avoiding heavy weapon fire.
* **[Scout](ships/classes/scout)**: Unlike other military ships, scouts do not focus on direct firepower and instead influence the battlefield through reconnaissance and analysis.

## Civilian Ships

Civilian ships tend to focus on utility and bonuses such as cargo inertia or maximum cargo capacity.
While they are not meant for combat, they can still be outfitted to fight.

### Large Ships

* **[Bulk Freighter](ships/classes/bulk_freighter)**: Designed to haul large amounts of goods across space, they usually sport fighter bays as a for of defense.

### Medium Ships

* **[Armoured Transport](ships/classes/armoured_transport)**: In between civilian and military ships, armoured transports offer a good balance between cargo delivery and firepower.
* **[Freighter](ships/classes/freighter)**: One of the more popular options for good deliveries, however, they are quite lacking in defenses.

### Small Ships

* **[Courier](ships/classes/courier)**: A fast option to deliver goods throughout the universe.
* **[Yacht](ships/classes/yacht)**: Commonly used for recreation and small deliveries.
