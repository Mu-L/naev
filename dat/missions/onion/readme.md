12. **onion13:** epilogue where the player gets control of the station and can do a single jump to a location while DOG disappears into the Nebula


### Notes

* **Peeling** is the equivalent to "doxxing" in the Onion Society.
* The Onion Society motto is *"Going to make you cry!"*
* Message capsules are small autonomous drones called "**Nexus Relays**" or just "**Relays**" that jump back and forth through jump lanes to transmit information at speeds faster than light, with also quantum entangling at a system level. Having priority access through them is really expensive, and most information and data is transmitted at much slower speeds. Bypassing the mechanism is known as **shorting**.
* **The Nexus** is the equivalent to cyberspace, although it is much more heterogeneous and inconsistent as it is mainly patched through sneaking packets into messages and hacked message capsules.
