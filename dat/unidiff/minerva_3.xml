 <spob name="Minerva Station">
  <description>The station consists of essentially one gigantic gambling complex. No matter where you go, there seems to be gambling going on, that combined with the constant coming and going of ships, creates a very high-energy frenetic environment. When docking to the station there is a big neon says that displays "What happens in Limbo, stays in Limbo". The station was remodeled after an unexplained large explosion took out a large part of the station.

There seem to be a lot more shadier characters around the station than you last remember. Could this be the result of the new CEO of Minerva Station? Who could they be?</description>
