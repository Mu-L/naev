 <description>Even though the Starbridge is already a light and fast destroyer, Skull and Bones engineers managed to further improve its speed. Due to its large firepower and relatively high speed for its ship class, the Starbridge is truly a fearsome sight.

 FLF technicians were also able to adapt some technology found in their ventures into the nebula into this model, drastically increasing its resistance to both nebula electronic interference and volatile nebula damage. Anticipating longer ventures through nebula space, the FLF engineers also used some not-exactly-stable modifications to adjust its fuel usage, greatly increasing its range at the cost of some defensive capability and cargo space.</description>
