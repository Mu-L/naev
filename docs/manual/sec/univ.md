# Systems and System Objects

An important aspect of Naev is the universe. The universe is formed by isolated systems, of which only one is simulated at any given time. The systems are connected to each other forming a large graph. Each system can contain an arbitrary number of objects known as *System Objects (Spobs)*, which the player can, for example land on or perform other actions.

Most System and Spob editing can be done using the in-game editor. This is disabled by default, but by either starting the game with `--devmode` or enabling `devmode = true` in the configuration file will enable this functionality. Afterwards, an `Editor` button should appear in the main menu that should open the universe editor.
